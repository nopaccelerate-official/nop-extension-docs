# Licensing Issues

## **Question 1** 
**What will happen when the license expires?**

### **Solution**

### **Subscription License**
If your subscription license expires, the **nopAccelerate Plus plugin will stop working**.  
When this happens:

- Search & Catalog pages will automatically fall back to **default nopCommerce methods**  
- You will **lose advanced search** and **drill-down filtering** features on:
  - Search Results
  - Category Pages
  - Manufacturer Pages
  - Vendor Pages
  - Product Tag Pages

---

### **Download License (Perpetual License)**
If you are using a Download license:

- The nopAccelerate Plus plugin **continues to work**  
- However, **support & updates stop** after the license expiry
- You won’t receive:
  - Bug fixes  
  - Improvements  
  - New features  

> **Recommended:** Renew your download license annually to receive ongoing updates and support.

You will also receive **automatic email reminders** before and after license expiration.

## **Question 2**  
**What will happen if the license suddenly fails? Will it impact my website visitors?**

### **Solution**

If a license failure occurs (e.g., validation issues, expired license, wrong domain):

- Your **website visitors are NOT affected**  
- Your live store continues to run using **default nopCommerce methods**
- The plugin features stop only on:
  - Search pages
  - Catalog pages  
  … if the license is invalid or unauthorized

Only the **administration area** will show license warnings.

If your key was valid once and approved, temporary failures will **not affect your visitors**.

## **Question 3** 
**How will I get notified about license issues?**

### **Solution**

You will see a **Warning Notification** on top of:

- nopAccelerate Plus configuration pages  
- nopAccelerate settings pages  

These warnings explain the exact license issue so you can take action.

**Pop-up Engage Plugin Overview**

The Pop-up Engage plugin triggers based on *exit intent*. When a customer adds a product to their cart and tries to leave without checking out, the plugin displays a pop-up window.

- **If the customer is not logged in:**  
  The pop-up asks them to subscribe using their email address.  
  You can also choose a topic page, and the pop-up will show that topic’s content along with the subscription option.

- **If the customer is logged in:**  
  The pop-up skips the subscription step and directly shows the selected topic page content.

Additionally, the plugin includes another pop-up that appears on the home page whenever a customer visits the site.

# Installation & Licensing

- Download the plugin package and place it inside your **Plugins** folder.

- Follow the standard nopCommerce plugin installation procedure. The **Pop-up Engage** plugin will appear under the **“Xcellence-IT”** group on the **Local Plugins** page.

- After installing, go to: **nopAccelerate > Popup Engage > Configure**

- The system will ask for your license key. Enter the license key you received on your registered email after purchasing the plugin from our website.

- Make sure to give **read/write permissions** to the IIS user on the server where your website is hosted, so the plugin can be installed and work correctly.

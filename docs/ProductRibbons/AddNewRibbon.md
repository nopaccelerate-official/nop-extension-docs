1. **Ribbon name** : This is the name of the ribbon and is a required field. It is needed so that you can distinguish your ribbons from each other, as you can create as many ribbons as you want.
2. **Ribbon Start Date** : Set the start date from which the ribbon will be activated. This is especially useful, for example, when you want to show a ribbon for a seasonal sale, as you can specify when the promotion should start.
3. **Ribbon End Date** : Set the end date until which the ribbon will be active. This is useful when you want to stop displaying the ribbon after this date.
4. **Enabled** : When enabled, the ribbon is available for display on the Home page.
5. **Display Order** : A lower number indicates a higher priority. Set the priority of the product ribbon accordingly.
6. **Mark As New** : Check or uncheck to enable or disable. The ribbon will apply to products marked as new (applies to new products in nopCommerce).
7. **Do not Display More Ribbon after this** :  If multiple ribbons could be shown for a product, checking this option ensures that no other ribbon is displayed after this one.
8. **Limited to Store** : Use this option to limit the ribbon to a specific store. If you have multiple stores, select one or more from the list. Leave this field empty if you do not want to limit it to any store.

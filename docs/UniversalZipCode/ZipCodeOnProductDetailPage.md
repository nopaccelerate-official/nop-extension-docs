The Zip Code check section on the Product Details page appears as shown in the image below.

After entering a zip code:

- The system verifies whether **delivery** and **COD** are available for that location..
- The site will not prompt for the zip code again.

If you want to modify the design of the Zip Code control, edit the following file:

**Plugins → XcellenceIt.ZipCode → Views → Shared → Components → ZipCodeAvailability → Default.cshtml**

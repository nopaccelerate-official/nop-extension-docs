The Zip Code check section on the product detail page appears as shown in the image below.

After entering a Zip Code:

- The system verifies whether **Delivery** and **COD** are available for that location.
- The site will not prompt for the Zip Code again on future visits.

If you want to modify the design of the Zip Code control, edit the following file:

**Plugins → XcellenceIt.ZipCode → Views → Shared → Components → ZipCodeAvailability → Default.cshtml**

**Universal ZipCode plug-in** is a complete, feature-rich solution for nopCommerce. It allows your visitors to quickly check whether their delivery location is serviceable and if **Cash on Delivery (COD)** is available for their area.

Visitors can view this information directly on the **Product Detail** page, reducing checkout drop-offs. The plug-in also helps you discover locations that users are requesting but you currently don’t serve, allowing you to expand coverage strategically.

You can prompt users to enter their zip code on their first visit. Once entered, the plug-in remembers it, so they don’t need to check again.

The plug-in also prevents checkout with non-serviceable zip codes and automatically disables the COD payment method when it’s unavailable.

Zip codes with their shipping and COD status can be maintained easily in a simple Excel file, which can be imported directly into nopCommerce.

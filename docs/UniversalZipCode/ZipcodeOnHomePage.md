When a new customer visits the store homepage, a pop-up will automatically appear (if enabled) asking for their Zip Code.

After entering the Zip Code:

- The site checks whether **Delivery** and **COD** are available for that Zip Code.
- The information appears on the product detail page.
- The customer will not be asked for their Zip Code again.

If you want to customize the design of the pop-up window, you can modify the view file located at:

**Plugins → XcellenceIt.ZipCode → Views → Shared → Components → ZipCodeHomePage → Default.cshtml**

**Bundled Discounts Plug-in for nopCommerce** enables the store owner to boost sales by offering discounts when customers purchase additional products along with the one they originally intend to buy.

---

The store owner can create **bundle(s)** on a *base product* and set a **discount amount** that applies when the bundle is purchased.

They can add discounts for bundles and link additional products to the base product within each bundle. The customer will receive the configured discount when buying that bundle.

---

Customers can view bundle offers on the **product details page** of the base product. They can directly add bundle products to the cart from this page.  
If any bundle product has attributes, the plug-in will display a **pop-up window** for attribute selection.

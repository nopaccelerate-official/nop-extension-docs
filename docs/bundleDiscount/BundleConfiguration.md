If you cannot view **Manage bundles** tab on Product Edit page, please check if the product agrees to any one of the following conditions:

- It is a group product.  
- It is a gift card.  
- Customer Enters Price is enabled for the product.

If none of the above conditions apply to your product, you can get help from our team. Please refer

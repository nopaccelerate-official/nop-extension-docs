# Customer Event Settings Tab

After that you need to set customer event settings as shown in image below. You can also edit customer message templates at same time. We have also provided message tokens which are allowed from nopCommerce. You may use these message tokens to dynamically prepare your message template. Our plug-in automatically resolves message token at time of sending messages. You can select which customer event settings you want to activate so you can check/enable only those event settings.

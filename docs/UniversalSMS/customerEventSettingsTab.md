# Customer Event Settings Tab

After that, configure the Customer Event Settings as shown in the image below. You can also edit the customer message templates at the same time.
We have provided message tokens that are supported by nopCommerce. You may use these tokens to dynamically construct your message templates.
The plugin automatically resolves the message tokens at the time the messages are sent.
You can select which customer event settings you want to activate by enabling only the required event settings.

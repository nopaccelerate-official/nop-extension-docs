# Send Individual message

- If Individual Message is enabled, the corresponding tab will be displayed on the Order Edit page and Customer Edit page, as shown in the image below. 
- The image below shows the individual message form for a customer from the administrator panel in nopCommerce. You can send individual messages to customers from two locations:  
- **Customers → Customers → Edit (select any customer for edit) → Send message (tab)**.  
- **Sales → Orders → View (select any order to view) → Send message (tab)**.  
If Private Message is enabled, you can also send the same message as a private message to the customer.
